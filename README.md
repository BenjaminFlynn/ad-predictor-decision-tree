# ad-predictor-decision-tree
A machine learning project that uses decision trees to predict ad click behavior based on user demographics and online activity. Includes data exploration, model training, and performance evaluation.

# 🧠 Ad Click Predictor Using Decision Trees

This project demonstrates how decision tree models can be used to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on behavioral and demographic features. This is a supervised learning task aimed at understanding user behavior for targeted advertising — a concept that aligns closely with data science applications in marketing and insurance analytics.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Digital advertisers want to optimize the delivery of ads to maximize engagement (click-through rates). This project models the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad using a dataset with the following features:

- Daily time spent on site
- Age
- Area income
- Daily internet usage
- Gender
- Ad timestamp
- Clicked on ad (target variable)

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore and clean the data.
- Visualize feature distributions and correlations.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict ad clicks.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Interpret decision boundaries and tree splits for business insights.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn
- **Modeling**: DecisionTreeClassifier (scikit-learn)

## 🧪 Results

- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (fill in based on your results).
- Key predictors of ad clicks included **[top features]**.
- The decision tree revealed intuitive splits, showing how time on site and income interact with click likelihood.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Tune hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split) using GridSearchCV.
- Try ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
- Analyze model fairness across demographics.
- Deploy a Streamlit demo to allow real-time ad click prediction.

## 📌 Relevance to Real-World Applications

Understanding what drives user actions is central to fields like **marketing analytics**, **insurance telematics**, and **consumer segmentation**. This project demonstrates:

- Use of interpretable models (decision trees) for customer behavior prediction.
- Techniques that can be extended to **pricing**, **underwriting**, and **personalization** in industries like insurance.
